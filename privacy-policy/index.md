You are on my website, davidpfahler.com. I am David Pfahler and have created this site using a privacy-first approach. This means that this site collects as little data about you as possible for the services it provides. In this privacy notice document, I will inform you about your rights as a data subject and explain how and why I use your personal data when you visit this site.

## Personal data

According to Article 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person

## Person responsible

The person responsible within respect to the data protection laws, in particular the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is:

David Pfahler,
Keltenschanze 6a,
85716 Unterschleißheim

email: david@davidpfahler.com
phone: +4915150406258

## Your rights

You have certain rights under data protection law, which we must tell you about. The rights available to you depend on our reason for processing your data. In general, you have the following rights:

1. Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR)
2. Right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR)
3. Right erasure (‘right to be forgotten’) (Art. 17 GDPR)
4. Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR)
5. Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR)
6. Right to object (Art. 21 GDPR)

If and to the extent the processing is based on consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1)(1)(a) or Art. 9 (2)(a) GDPR, you have the right to revoke the consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until revocation.

Please note your right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority. A list of the supervisory authorities (for the non-public sector) can be found here https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html.

There is no automated decision making.

## Your right to object pursuant Art. 21 GDPR

You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning you which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR, including profiling based on those provisions. We will no longer process the personal data unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

## Processing activities

### Accessing my website

### Processing activity

If you access this website (or any website for that matter), information of a general nature is automatically collected. This information includes, for example, the type of web browser, the operating system used, the domain name of your Internet service provider, your IP address and so on. Please note that it is not up to me that this data is transmitted, but it is fundamental to how the web and your browser software work.

### Purpose and legal basis:

These data are processed to ensure a proper connection and operation of this website. I do not use your data to draw conclusions about you. I may evaluate a statistical aggregate of these data if this helps me to optimize this website.

All data processing activities need a legal basis under the GDPR. The legal basis for the processing of the information described above is Art. 6(1)(1)(f) GDPR, that is my legitimate interest in providing and improving the functionality and stability of this website.

### Recipients:

This website is hosted with GitHub Pages and Amazon Web Services, so naturally the information described above is sent to these recipients so they can provide the hosting for this website.

### Storage period:

I do not store this data beyond the life of the connection to this website. GitHub Pages or Amazon Web Services may retain this data longer for security purposes or their own purposes.

## Privacy notices of other websites

This website contains links to other websites. This privacy notice applies only to this website, so if you click on a link to another website, you should read their privacy notices.
