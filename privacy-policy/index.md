You are on my website, davidpfahler.com. I am David Pfahler and have created this site. In this privacy notice document, I will inform you about your rights as a data subject and explain how and why I use your personal data when you visit this site. In the following, I will refer to myself and my website as "we", "us" or "our", because this is how I designed the clauses below.

## Personal data

According to Article 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

## Your rights

You have certain rights under data protection law, which we must tell you about. The rights available to you depend on our reason for processing your data. In general, you have the following rights:

1. Right of access (Article 15 GDPR)
2. Right to rectification (Article 16 GDPR)
3. Right erasure (‘right to be forgotten’) (Article 17 GDPR)
4. Right to restriction of processing (Article 18 GDPR)
5. Right to data portability (Article 20 GDPR)
6. Right to object (Article 21 GDPR)

If and to the extent the processing is based on consent pursuant to Article 6 (1)(1)(a) or Article 9 (2)(a) GDPR, you have the right to revoke the consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until revocation.

Please note your right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority. A list of the supervisory authorities (for the non-public sector) can be found here https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html.

There is no automated decision making.

## Your right to object pursuant Article 21 GDPR

You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning you which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR, including profiling based on those provisions. We will no longer process the personal data unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
